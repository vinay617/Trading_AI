2) We want to build a moving average crossover strategy for 21 and 50 sma, implement the same and give the entry and exit signals. BUY signal = when 21 sma crosses over 50 sma from below and SELL Signal = when 21 sma crosses under 50 sma from above. Show the Buy signal with +1 and Sell Signal with -1, No signal means 0.

3) Now let's backtest this strategy, assuming we have a starting capital of Rs. 2,00,000. Show the Profit and Loss of each trade in the excel sheet, Trade with 1 lot of Nifty Futures = 50 shares.Take both long and short side trades.

4) Give the list of each trade. Also mention total number of trades, Number of profitable trades, Number of loss trades,Compounded returns.

In the end, Let me know if the Strategy is profitable and also how much Profit/loss was made in both absolute and percentage terms.
